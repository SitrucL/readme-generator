# WIP - README.md Generator

## Setup and installation

-   Clone and install this repo

-   You'll need to create a `.env` file and add `OPENAI_KEY` to it

-   You'll aslo need to edit `line 5` of `index.ts` with the path to this repo's `.env`

## Usage

In your terminal, navigate to a repo that you want to create a README.md for and then run the `index.ts` file using `ts-node` like so :

```
ts-node ~/GENERTIC_DIRECTORY/readme-bot/src/index.ts
```

(Creating an alias or function within your .zshrc or equaivalent is advised)
